### IPL Auction Strategy Analysis Using SQL

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive auction strategy for a new Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise by analyzing historical IPL data. The primary goal is to build a strong and balanced squad by selecting players based on their past performances, considering metrics like strike rate, batting average, bowling economy, and strike rate. The project uses SQL for data manipulation and analysis, with data sourced from IPL seasons 1 to 13.

**Project Objectives:**

- **Data Ingestion:** Load IPL match and ball-by-ball data into a SQL database from CSV files.
- **Player Analysis:** Identify key players for the auction based on specific performance metrics:
  - **Batsmen:** Analyze strike rates, batting averages, and boundary percentages to select aggressive batsmen, anchor batsmen, and finishers.
  - **Bowlers:** Evaluate bowlers based on their economy rates and strike rates to choose the most effective wicket-takers.
  - **All-Rounders:** Identify versatile players with strong performances in both batting and bowling.
  - **Wicketkeepers:** Define criteria to select the best wicketkeepers who can contribute significantly with the bat and behind the stumps.
- **Auction Strategy:** Develop a strategy to bid for players while staying within the budget and ensuring a balanced squad composition.
- **Visualization:** Present the analyzed data and final player selection in visually appealing formats such as charts, graphs, and tables for effective decision-making during the auction.

**Key Features:**

- **SQL Queries:** Complex SQL queries to filter and sort players based on multiple performance criteria.
- **Custom Tables:** Creation of new tables with additional calculated fields for easier data analysis.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** In-depth analysis covering various aspects of player performance, including batting, bowling, and fielding.
- **Visual Representation:** Data visualization to aid in the presentation of auction strategy to the management team.
